DNA:
Comprised of four chromosomes (sets of neural network weights)
Determine whether or not to stay
set-chromI [(_ _ _ _ _ _)(_ _ _ _ _ _)...]

Determine whether or not to move/where to move
set-chromM [(_ _ _ _ _ _)(_ _ _ _ _ _)...]

Determine whether or not to destroy/where to destroy
set-chromD [(_ _ _ _ _ _)(_ _ _ _ _ _)...]

Determine whether or not to build/where to build
set-chromB [(_ _ _ _ _ _)(_ _ _ _ _ _)...]

Each neural network takes its chromosome and determines its own outcome


TASK BREAKDOWN:
Genetic algorithm evolves the neural network

Agent sends current situation attributes (neighborNorth, neighborEast,
 neighborSouth, neighborWest, xPosSelf, yPosSelf, xPosOther, yPosOther) to
 neural networks and gets back the move it should make ('bn) or ('dn 'ds) etc.

Neural networks (one to determine which type of action to take that calls the
 others, one to determine where to move, one to determine where to destroy, and
 one to determine where to build) take chromosomes of six-bit binary numbers
 that represent individual neural network weights.
